# EQ

There is a good website with frequencies for different instruments at https://blog.sonicbids.com/the-ultimate-eq-cheat-sheet-for-every-common-instrument 

I've tried to sum up the common one we need below.

### Bass Guitar

- **40 to 80 Hz - Bottom:** Especially with five-string variations, this is where the bottom resonances of most basses live
- **80 to 200 Hz - Fundamentals:** The primary fundamental of the bass. Right around 180 to 200 Hz is where you can try to cut in on a bass that is too "boomy" to clean it up while preserving fundamentals
- **200 to 600 Hz - Overtones:** These are the upper harmonics of most bass tones, depending on the sound you're interested in. If you're having trouble getting a bass to cut through in a mix, especially a low-end heavy one or one that's getting played back on smaller speakers, this can be where to look
- **300 to 500 Hz - Wood:** Particularly in upright basses, it's that distinctive, woody bark
- **800 to 1,600k Hz - Bite:** The growl and attack of most basses can be either emphasized or toned down around here
- **2,000 to 5,000 Hz - String noise:** Pretty straightforward here, I think

### Acoustic Guitar

- **120 to 200 Hz - Boom/Body:** This is where you'll find most of the explosive low end on a mic'd acoustic that tends to feedback in the live world or be disruptive in the studio. A little bit here adds warmth and fullness on a solo performance, but in a dense band mix, it's probably better to get it out of the way
- **200 to 400 Hz - Thickness/Wood:** This is the main "body" of most acoustic tones. Too many cuts here, and you're going to lose the life of the guitar somewhat
- **2,000 Hz - Definition/Harshness:** This double-edged sword band will give the definition to the acoustic tone to hear intricacies in chords and picking, but too much will make it harsh and aggressive
- **7,000 Hz - Air/Sparkle:** A touch, and I mean a *touch*, of a shelf boost here can help open up an acoustic sound

### Keyboard

- **100 to 200 Hz - Boom:** As with its acoustic counterpart, the low end can go from lush to overgrown Jurassic underbrush quickly. Particularly with the rich, dense harmonics of something like a Rhodes, cutting "mud" is usually your first order of business
- **800 to 1,000 Hz - Bark:** Managing the "bark" and damper noise can sometimes be an issue, but if things are cutting through too much, odds are it's somewhere in this range

### Vocal

- **100 Hz and below - Rumble:** For most vocals, all you'll find down here is mic-handling noise, stage/floor vibrations, air conditioners, etc. Get rid of it
- **200 Hz - Boom:** This frequency is usually where you'll find the "head cold" sound. The female voice may run a little higher, but this is the ballpark. Anyone with allergies or sinus issues knows exactly what I'm talking about
- **800 to 1,000 Hz - Word Clarity/Nasality:** Not enough and intelligibility of some lyrics may be unintelligible, too much and you get the teacher from *Peanuts*
- **3,000 Hz- Presence/Excitement:** This is right around the point that tends to add some energy, or some "buzz" to a vocal. Not enough, and the vocal may sound deflated, flat, and dull. Too much, and your listener will feel like he or she is getting poked in the ear canal with a chopstick every time the vocalist opens his or her mouth
- **4,000 to 8,000 Hz - Sizzle/Sibilants:** Typically this is the range a de-esser is handling. If your vocalist sounds like meat hitting a hot pan at the end of any word ending in "s" or a similar sound, this is where to hunt
- **10,000 Hz and up - Air:** Want to "open up" your vocal a little? Apply a light shelf boost around here and that should do it. This is not always necessary, though, and simply adding "air" for the sake of it can make things harsh, brittle, and introduce noise to the sound
